# SHAPEAI_Javascript_and_Reactjs_BOOTCAMP
&lt;/b>. The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. &lt;br>&lt;br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well&lt;br> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zl8TDRnbulLetcbkthT0p_IzwgRAYbu"> &lt;img src="https://github.com/ShapeAI/PYTHON-AND-DATA-ANALYTICS/blob/main/YOUTUBE%20THUMBNAIL-4.png"> &lt;/a> &lt;br>I got to have hands on experience on: &lt;li>JavaScript &lt;li>HTML &lt;li>React.js &lt;br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
